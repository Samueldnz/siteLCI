## Attribute Survey Repository from the UFRJ DCC Site for Migration to IC

This repository contains an attribute survey file from the former website of the Department of Computer Science (DCC) at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). The objective of this survey is to identify and document all elements and functionalities present on the DCC website to facilitate the migration of these attributes to the new Instituto de Computação (IC) website.

### Goal

The main objective of this repository is to create a complete and organized record of the key elements found on the UFRJ DCC website, including navigation menus, content sections, useful links and specific functionalities. This will help with the content development and migration process for the new IC website, ensuring that no essential elements are lost in the transition process.
